<b>FOCUS AREA:</b> Mistakes can happen in any field except the medical field because it can be a huge loss and making one's family in a very inconvenient state.

Today india is moving a step towards digitilised country but it needs a huge changeover in medical field our idea solves more than 90% of medical issues which we are facing in the todays world. 


<h3>PROBLEMS FACED:</h3>


Today medical field became a big bussiness mark for some doctors and they are making money in a wrong way and thay are misusing it.


<b>NOTE:</b> Let us assume the same situation to explain the drawbacks in the medical fields


<b>TYPE 1 (For ex:)</b>


 If a patient is suffering from high fever and he visited to nearby hospital 1 and doctor suggested him to take injections and tablets which are more than necessary so the patient doesnt know what to do at that time so he purchased all the medicines which are suggested by the doctor.In this case doctors targets on patient economic situation and then decides to give medicines to them


<b>TYPE 2 (For ex:)</b>


 If a patient is suffering from high fever and he visited to nearby hospital 1 and doctor 1 suggested him to take some kind of  injections for 3 days and patient takes medicines according to the doctors instructions and the patient is not satisfied with the doctor treatment  and he moves to hospital 2 and doctor 2 doesnt know about previous medical records and he also gives the same medicines where he used to take the medicines used by doctor 1 there are many ways to cure the disease but unfortunately the two doctors has given the same treatment which is not at all deals with the patient problems In this case it may lead to patient death.


<b>TYPE 3(For ex)</b>


In this case doctor doesnt have any idea about the patient medical issue and he doesnt   know what to do and what not to do althogh the doctors suggests medicines irrelated to their disease. 


Not onlt these three  cases thare are many criminal activities done by some of the doctors which are not known by thie staff and patients too.


The main reason behind all these criminal activities that the we cant retrive the medical records of a person,


So for all these following issues there is only one way we should digitalise medical field too such that there will no criminal activities takes place.

There are so many difficulties facing by the patient in almost all hospital because of-

1.paper based record

2.security

3.attendant

4.electronic medical record

5.patients


<h3>SOLUTION:</h3>



So we purpose our idea “SCAN-X”  in two ways 


<b>1)SCAN-X mobile app</b>



<b>2)SCAN-X barcode scanner</b>



We provide unique barcodes for each and every patient and we will verify and fetch the details according to their aadhar identification we will update  basic medical info about patient.

 ex: blood group and present medical position .


When a person goes  to a specific hospital the hospital mangement has barcode scanner and scans the patient unique barcode and thay come to know about the medical position and it is responsibility is taken by the hospital management to fill the details and prescription given by the doctors and we are having  a team of experienced doctors and they will verify the prescription given by that specific doctor and we will verify it .


After the treatment the hospital management must update the present medical status of a patient.


So whenever he moves to other hospital the management can fetch the details of patient ex:what are the medicines he used before and the present medical status etc.


<b>WAYS TO USE THE APP:</b>


one who has  good pratice in mobile they can register themselves in the app by aadhar OTP verification process and can check their present medical status.

(This app contain barcode,basic info of patient etc.)


One who doesnt have a good pratice in app usage we provide  barcode and they retrive their data nearby SCAN-X help centers for free of cost 


By this process we centralise all the hospitals in one platform and we stop all false treatment and can save the patients from the fraud doctors.


 <b>USES:</b>

Retriving data of patients of previous medical records.

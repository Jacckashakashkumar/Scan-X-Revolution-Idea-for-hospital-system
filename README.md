# Scan-X-Revolution-Idea-for-hospital-system
 we propose scan-x which having   medical patient informations.. which is a piece of card on which  bar code is there and little information about that such as photo,name,and address. and we have app name scan-x for it its having same feature which is in that card. and patient have to buy on yearly  subscription from hospitals. now lets see how its works.   lets us take patient 1 is going to hospital 1 and pysicians  have to scan that code and its show the medical patient information on the hospital server .  this will help to show the information abouts that patient  and any update about it. this would overcome the efficiency. lets us take Patient 1 is going to another hospital 2 which is hospital-2 then that hospital-2 pysicians scan the code and hospital server will retrieve the  medical data of patient from the hospital-1.

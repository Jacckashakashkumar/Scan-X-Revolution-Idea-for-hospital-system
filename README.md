# Scan-X-Revolution-Idea-for-hospital-system<br/>
There are so many difficulties facing by  patient in almost all hospital because of-<br/>
1.paper based record<br/>
2.security<br/><br/>
2.attendant<br/>
3.electronic medical record<br/>
4.patients<br/>
These are some difficulties  faced by  patients in hospital.<br/>
case #1.paper based record<br/>
There is increasing pressure on hospitals to provide effective cost savings, reduce patient waiting times
 and improve the patient experience.<br/>
<br/>
Much inefficiency is due to patient information not being readily available, for example tests are repeated 
because the previous results cannot be accessed or available in the paper notes
Although some medical documents are being scanned, the way in which scanning is used still requires that the
 original documents be kept for legal purposes, thus not alleviating the storage problem.
Overall, clinicians want to be consulted and involved in the specification of a solution, because they will be the ones using it..<br/><br/>
Challenge #3 Security<br/><br/>
Practices avoiding a complete transition to electronic client files often do so with the belief that an electronic system is more of a security threat. <br/><br/>
because of paper document there is not secure system or information about the patients.<br/>
 These challenges can be broken down into accessibility, productivity and security<br/>
There are not such effective system in India  which can solve this big issue .<br/>
whereas in emergency  hospital not having such information about that patient.<br/>
<br/><br/><br/>

And these process is very time consuming,Inaccurates and incomplete in the hospital.<br/>
According to our student survey about 90% of the student are agree related to this that they facing these type of problem to.
Reason behind of it that is hospital cant retrieve data of patient from electrical euipment or may be they don't know about that.
<br/>


so so we propose scan-x which having   medical patient informations..
which is a piece of card on which  bar code is there and little information about that such as photo,name,and address.
and we have app name scan-x for it its having same feature which is in that card.
and patient have to buy on yearly  subscription from hospitals.
now lets see how its works. 
<br/>
lets us take patient 1 is going to hospital 1 and pysicians have to scan that code and its show the medical patient information on the hospital server .
<br/>
this will help to show the information abouts that patient  and any update about it.
this would overcome the efficiency.
lets us take Patient 1 is going to another hospital 2 which is hospital-2
then that hospital-2 pysicians scan the code and hospital server will retrieve the  medical data of patient from the hospital-1.
<br/>
now talk about Accessibilities
Improved quality of Health care 
Implementation of National Level.
<br/>
Bussiness plan
<br/>
sustained by nominal fee -yearly subscription by patient in hospitals
<br/>
Scan-x is low cost quick and effective solution to recurrent problem in Emergency cases..
<br/>
